There are many reads of the index file, which generally are small files.  Not
sure of overall affect this has.

The OnDiskData object should be more generalized, and maybe hold more
data like the index file name.

There was a lot of cut & paste on the reading the index file code, should be dealt
with somehow. 

Many for-each loops are working off lists or Sets, which may not be that
optimal.
